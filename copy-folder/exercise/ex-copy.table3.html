                            Strawberry’s red colour comes from its high amount of antioxidant compounds known as anthocyanins. It’s also a natural source of saccharides which help hydrate skin.

                                Research has shown strawberry is a very good source of vitamin C. The combination of that plus the numerous other antioxidants is what allows strawberry to help skin to better withstand environmental damage; in fact, strawberry can helps shield supportive elements in skin from harm, allowing them to stay flexible and resilient longer. What’s more, it does so quickly, providing this benefit within 30 minutes of application.
